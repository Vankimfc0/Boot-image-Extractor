## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

If you encounter any bugs, please help us improve Boot Image Extractor by reporting them. Before creating a bug report, please check if an existing issue already addresses your concern. 

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side (e.g., using incompatible environment components/versions). Make sure that you have read the [documentation](). If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#contact).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue, check if there is an existing bug report for your issue in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/gitclone-url/Boot-image-Extractor/issues?q=label%3Abug).
- Search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
- Collect information about the bug:
  - Stack trace (Traceback)
  - OS, Platform, and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
  - Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
  - Possibly your input and the output
  - Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?
  
To report a bug:
1. Open an issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/gitclone-url/Boot-image-Extractor/issues).
2. Select the bug report template.
3. Read the instructions carefully and fill out the template with as much detail as possible.
4. Submit the issue and wait for support.

1. Open an issue on the [GitHub Issues page](https://github.com/gitclone-url/Boot-image-Extractor/issues).
2. Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
3. Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
4. **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
5. **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Boot Image Extractor users. You may also want to point out other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.
6. Include any relevant examples or code snippets if applicable.
